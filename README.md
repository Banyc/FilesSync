# Files Sync

Synchronize filesystem from a local folder to a remote folder for transparent files deployment.

The local folder is an active publisher while the remote folder is a passive subscriber.

No remote-side client is needed. File transmission is via SSH protocol. 

Each remote folder only corresponds to one local folder but each local folder can have multiply remote folders.
